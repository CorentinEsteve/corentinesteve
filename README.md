## Hi there 👋 I'm Corentin

Full-stack engineer building clean, useful products end-to-end — **React/TypeScript + Node.js + Python**.  
I like shipping fast, then making it **solid**: reliability, observability, and sharp UX.  

These days I’m also integrating **AI/LLMs** (tool-calling, agentic workflows, transcription) with real-world constraints: **latency, cost, privacy** 🧠🔧

- 🔭 Currently: shipping SaaS features + pragmatic AI assistants (low-noise, high-value)
- 🌱 Learning: agentic patterns, evals/monitoring, better product thinking
- 🧩 I enjoy: turning messy data into dashboards that actually help people
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m addicted to “simplify first” — fewer moving parts = fewer bugs 😄
